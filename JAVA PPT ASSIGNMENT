Assignment no.4
Q.NO1>Write a program to show Interface Example in java?
Ans:-
interface Animal {
  public void animalSound(); // interface method (does not have a body)
  public void sleep(); // interface method (does not have a body)
}


class Lion implements Animal {
  public void animalSound() {
    // The body of animalSound() is provided here
    System.out.println("The lion roars");
  }
  public void sleep() {
   
    System.out.println("Zzz");
  }
}

class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Lion myLion= new Lion();  
    myLion.animalSound();
    myLion.sleep();
  }
}

QNO.2>Q2.Write a program a Program with 2 concrete method and 2 abstract method in java ?
ANS:-

QN0.3>Q3.Write a program  to show the use of functional interface in java?
interface Sample{
    int calculate(int val);
}
// public class
public class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        
     
        Sample solution = (int val) -> val+55;
         
        System.out.println("Ans = "+ solution.calculate(55));
    }

Q.NO>4 .What is an interface in Java?
ANS:-1>Interfaces in Java are a set of abstract and public methods we want our classes to implement. It is the blueprint of a class and contains static constants and abstract methods.
Interfaces are used to achieve abstraction and implement multiple inherita
2>An interface is a set of abstract methods you would want your class to implement. These methods are public and abstract by default(you don’t have to explicitly use the “abstract” keyword),
and any class implementing your interface will need to provide implementations of those methods.
3>EG::interface CakeBakingService{
 public void mixIngredients();
 public void bakeCake();
 public void frostCake();
}


QNO:-5
What is the use of interface in Java?
...This are the some reason to use the interface
ANS:-1..Abstraction is achieved using an Interface in Java.
2..To achieve loose coupling.
3..Supports the functionality of multiple inheritances in Java.
4..The same signature must be used when overriding interface methods.
5..Interface methods must be implemented in classes that are not abstract.
6..Zero, one, or more interfaces can be implemented by a class at a time.
7..An interface in Java can extend another interface just like a class extends another class.



 Q.NO..What is the lambda expression of Java 8
A lambda expression is a short block of code which takes in parameters and returns a value. Lambda expressions are similar to methods,
but they do not need a name and they can be implemented right in the body of a method.

Syntax
The simplest lambda expression contains a single parameter and an expression:
parameter -> expression
